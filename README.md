AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Study

## Topic 1

### 📋 Quick Revision: AWS Global Infrastructure

#### 🌍 **Region**

* A **Region** is a **separate geographical area** where AWS has multiple data centers.
* Each Region contains all the resources (servers, networking, storage) needed to run AWS services.
* Regions are designed to provide **fault tolerance, high availability, and global reach**.
* Example: `us-west-2` (Oregon).

#### 🏢 **Availability Zone (AZ)**

* An **AZ** is an **isolated location** within a Region.
* Each AZ has its own **redundant power, networking, and connectivity**, physically separated from other AZs to minimize the impact of disasters.
* A Region typically has at least **3 or more AZs**, allowing for **high availability and failover**.
* When deploying in **Multi-AZ**, you design your workload across **two or more AZs** for resilience.

#### 🌐 **Edge Location**

* An **Edge Location** is a **data center closer to end users**, used to deliver content with **low latency**.
* They are part of AWS’s **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, leveraging **Points of Presence (PoPs)**.
* Primarily used for **caching and content delivery**, e.g., via Amazon CloudFront.

#### 📝 Notes:

* AWS is continuously adding more Regions and AZs.
* GovCloud Regions are specialized Regions for **government workloads** with stricter compliance.
* Be aware that the **AZ names (e.g., `us-west-2a`) can map differently in different AWS accounts**, but **AZ IDs** (`usw2-az1`) stay consistent.

### 🔍 Exam Tips:

- ✅ Know the difference between Region, AZ, and Edge Location.
- ✅ Understand why AWS separates workloads across AZs (fault tolerance).
- ✅ Remember that Edge Locations serve cached content closer to users (low latency).
- ✅ Recognize that AZs have independent infrastructure within a Region.

## Topic 2

### 📋 Quick Revision: AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The **Shared Responsibility Model** defines **who is responsible for what** when running workloads in AWS.
It splits responsibilities between **AWS** and **the customer (you)**.

### 🧑‍💻 **Customer Responsibility — Security *in* the Cloud**

You are responsible for everything you build, configure, and run **inside the cloud**:

* 🔐 **Data encryption** — You must encrypt your data at rest & in transit if required.
* 💾 **Backup** — You must back up your data to meet your compliance & recovery needs.
* 👥 **Access & authorization** — You control who can access what, using IAM, MFA, etc.
* 🖥️ **OS & network configuration** — You maintain and patch your operating systems, firewalls, and VPC settings for EC2 or other services where applicable.

### ☁️ **AWS Responsibility — Security *of* the Cloud**

AWS takes care of the infrastructure and services **underneath your workloads**:

* 🖥️ **Hardware maintenance** — Managing servers, storage, networking hardware.
* 🏢 **Physical security** — Controlling who enters data centers, surveillance, etc.
* 🔄 **Redundancy & global infrastructure** — Keeping Regions, AZs, and Edge Locations running.
* 📦 **Managed services software** — Patching and securing AWS-managed services.

### 📝 Key Phrase to Remember:

> ✨ **You are responsible for security *in* the cloud, AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud.**


### 🔍 Exam Tips:

- ✅ Know which responsibilities belong to AWS vs the customer.
- ✅ Be able to give examples of customer-controlled areas (e.g., IAM policies, S3 encryption).
- ✅ Understand that AWS’s responsibilities stop at the hypervisor & hardware layer — everything else is up to you.

## Topic 3

### 📋 Quick Revision: AWS Well-Architected Framework

The **Well-Architected Framework** provides **6 pillars** of best practices to design reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective cloud architectures.

You **must know these 6 pillars for the exam**, and understand examples of each.

### 🏗️ The 6 Pillars

#### 1️⃣ **Operational Excellence**

* Run and monitor systems effectively, continuously improve.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Operations as code
  🔹 Small, frequent changes
  🔹 Use managed services
  🔹 Collect metrics & gain insights

#### 2️⃣ **Security**

* Protect **data, systems, and assets** while delivering business value.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Encryption (at rest & in transit)
  🔹 Authentication & authorization controls
  🔹 Apply **layered security** (defense in depth)
  🔹 Maintain traceability (logging & monitoring)

#### 3️⃣ **Cost Optimization**

* Avoid unnecessary costs while meeting business needs.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Adopt a **consumption model** (pay for what you use)
  🔹 Use managed services where appropriate
  🔹 Measure and optimize efficiency
  🔹 Use discounts (e.g., Reserved Instances, Savings Plans)

#### 4️⃣ **Reliability**

* Ensure workloads perform as intended and recover quickly from failures.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Automate recovery (e.g., Auto Scaling, DNS failover)
  🔹 Test recovery procedures
  🔹 Design for horizontal scaling
  🔹 Monitor and handle changes in demand

#### 5️⃣ **Performance Efficiency**

* Use IT resources efficiently to meet system requirements.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Choose appropriate resources & instance types
  🔹 Experiment & innovate often
  🔹 Use serverless & global deployments
  🔹 Eliminate bottlenecks through testing and optimization

#### 6️⃣ **Sustainability**

* Minimize environmental impact of cloud workloads.
* Key practices:
  🔹 Right-size resources
  🔹 Increase utilization & avoid over-provisioning
  🔹 Scale on-demand instead of pre-allocating resources
  🔹 Use managed services to reduce footprint

### 🔍 Exam Tips:

- ✅ Memorize the **6 pillars & examples of each**.
- ✅ Many scenario-based questions test your ability to pick the best design aligned with one or more pillars.
- ✅ Remember: **Use managed services & automation whenever appropriate to achieve these goals.**
